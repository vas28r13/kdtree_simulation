Run:
        // To draw 3 lines originating from 1, 1
        java Point2D 1 1 3

        // To draw 5 rectangles generated by random points
        java RectHV 5

        // To draw KDTree using mouse clicks, clicks on popup to get the KDTree of clicked points
        java KdTreeVisualizer


        java RangeSearchVisualizer <file_name>

        <file_name> put your points in file_name in unit square
        RangeSearch builts the KD tree and performs the range search. It also performs the brute force range search.
        Red circle over points represents search via brute force method
        Blue circle over points represents search via KD-Tree method.


        Run the experiment with different value of N based on suggestion given in tutorial
        java experiment 10
        java experiment 100
        java experiment 1000
